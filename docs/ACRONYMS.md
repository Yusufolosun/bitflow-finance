- "The MCR is 150%, so a 15 STX deposit supports a 10 STX borrow."
- "Set the interest rate to 500 BPS (5% APR)."
- "Check the HF before borrowing; below 110% means liquidation risk."
- "Submit the TX and wait for the TXID confirmation."
- "The contract uses μSTX (microSTX) internally: 10 STX = 10,000,000 μSTX."
