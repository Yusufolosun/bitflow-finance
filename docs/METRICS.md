## Protocol Metrics Explained

The contract provides several read-only functions that return protocol-level metrics. Here's what each one means and how to use it.

### get-protocol-stats

Returns cumulative protocol activity:

```clarity
(contract-call? .bitflow-vault-core get-protocol-stats)
;; Returns: { total-deposits, total-repaid, total-liquidations }
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `total-deposits` | uint | Cumulative STX deposited (all time) |
| `total-repaid` | uint | Cumulative STX repaid (principal + interest) |
| `total-liquidations` | uint | Cumulative STX seized in liquidations |

**Important**: These are cumulative totals, not current balances. `total-deposits` includes STX that was later withdrawn.

### get-protocol-metrics

Returns time-based protocol data:

```clarity
(contract-call? .bitflow-vault-core get-protocol-metrics)
;; Returns: { protocol-age, time-since-last-activity }
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `protocol-age` | uint | Blocks since contract deployment |
| `time-since-last-activity` | uint | Blocks since last deposit/borrow/repay/liquidation |

**Conversion**: Multiply blocks by 10 to get approximate minutes. Divide by 144 for days.

### get-volume-metrics

Returns transaction volume data:

```clarity
(contract-call? .bitflow-vault-core get-volume-metrics)
;; Returns: { total-deposits, total-repaid, total-liquidations }
```

Same data as `get-protocol-stats`. Provided as an alias for clarity in volume-focused contexts.

### Derived Metrics

These can be calculated from the raw data:

| Metric | Calculation | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Net Deposits** | `total-deposits - total-withdrawn` | Current protocol TVL (requires off-chain tracking of withdrawals) |
| **Interest Earned** | `total-repaid - total-principal-repaid` | Revenue generated (requires event log analysis) |
| **Liquidation Rate** | `total-liquidations / total-deposits` | Risk indicator |
| **Activity Rate** | `1 / time-since-last-activity` | Protocol usage frequency |
| **Protocol Age (days)** | `protocol-age / 144` | Time since deployment |

### User-Level Metrics

| Function | Returns | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `get-user-deposit(user)` | uint | User's current deposit balance |
| `get-user-loan(user)` | optional tuple | Active loan details |
| `calculate-health-factor(user)` | uint | Position health (percentage) |
| `get-max-borrow-amount(user)` | uint | Available borrowing capacity |
| `get-user-position-summary(user)` | tuple | Combined position overview |
