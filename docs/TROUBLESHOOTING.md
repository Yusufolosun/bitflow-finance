## Quick Diagnostics

Before diving into specific issues, check these basics:

| Check | How | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| Wallet connected? | Look for address in top-right | `SP...` address visible |
| Correct network? | Check wallet settings | **Mainnet** selected |
| STX balance? | Check wallet or dashboard | Balance > 0 |
| Browser supported? | Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge | Modern browser, updated |
| Internet connection? | Try loading another site | Working connection |

## Deposit Issues

### "ERR-INVALID-AMOUNT" (Error u102)

**Symptom:** Transaction fails when trying to deposit.

**Cause:** You entered 0 or a negative amount.

**Fix:**
1. Enter an amount greater than 0
2. Make sure the input field contains a valid number (no letters or special characters)
3. Try again

### Deposit transaction stuck at "pending"

**Symptom:** You confirmed the deposit but it's been pending for more than 20 minutes.

**Cause:** Network congestion or low fee.

**Fix:**
1. Check your transaction on the [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.hiro.so)
2. Search for your address: `SP1M46W6CVGAMH3ZJD3TKMY5KCY48HWAZK0DYG193`
3. If the transaction is in the mempool, wait — it will eventually be mined or dropped
4. Stacks blocks average ~10 minutes, but can take 30+ minutes during congestion
5. If it disappears from the mempool after ~24 hours, try again

### Deposit succeeded but balance not updating

**Symptom:** Transaction confirmed on the explorer but the dashboard still shows old balance.

**Cause:** The frontend hasn't polled the new state yet.

**Fix:**
1. Wait 10 seconds for auto-refresh
2. Refresh the browser page (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R)
3. Disconnect and reconnect your wallet
4. Check the explorer directly — if the transaction was successful, your funds are safe

## Borrow Issues

### "ERR-INSUFFICIENT-COLLATERAL" (Error u105)

**Symptom:** Can't borrow the requested amount.

**Cause:** Your deposit is less than 150% of the borrow amount.

**Fix:**
1. Check your deposit balance on the dashboard
2. Calculate: `max borrow = deposit / 1.5`
3. Either deposit more STX first, or borrow a smaller amount

**Example:**
- Your deposit: 10 STX
- Max borrow: 10 / 1.5 = 6.66 STX
- If you tried to borrow 7 STX → error

### "ERR-ALREADY-HAS-LOAN" (Error u103)

**Symptom:** Can't borrow because you already have an active loan.

**Cause:** BitFlow allows one loan per user at a time.

**Fix:**
1. Check the Repay card for your active loan details
2. Repay your current loan first
3. After repayment confirms, you can borrow again

### "ERR-INVALID-INTEREST-RATE" (Error u110)

**Symptom:** Borrow fails with interest rate error.

**Cause:** Interest rate exceeds the maximum of 10,000 basis points (100% APR).

**Fix:**
1. The rate is in **basis points**: 100 = 1%, 500 = 5%, 1000 = 10%
2. Keep the rate between 1 and 10,000
3. Typical rates: 300–800 (3%–8% APR)

### "ERR-INVALID-TERM" (Error u111)

**Symptom:** Borrow fails with term error.

**Cause:** Loan term is outside the 1–365 day range.

**Fix:**
1. Choose a term between 1 and 365 days
2. Use the preset buttons (7, 30, 90, 365 days) to avoid errors

## Repayment Issues

### "ERR-NO-ACTIVE-LOAN" (Error u106)

**Symptom:** Can't repay because no loan exists.

**Cause:** You either already repaid, were liquidated, or never had a loan.

**Fix:**
1. Check the Repay card — if it shows "No active loan," you're clear
2. Check transaction history for a recent repayment or liquidation event
3. If you believe this is wrong, check the explorer for your address

### Not enough STX to repay

**Symptom:** You have an active loan but your wallet balance is less than the repayment amount.

**Cause:** Your wallet doesn't have enough STX to cover principal + interest.

**Fix:**
1. Check the total repayment amount in the Repay card
2. Buy or transfer more STX to your wallet
3. Once your balance covers the total (principal + interest + ~0.002 STX for gas), try again

### Interest higher than expected

**Symptom:** The repayment amount is more than you anticipated.

**Cause:** Interest accrues every block. The longer you wait, the more interest accumulates.

**Fix:**
1. This is expected behavior — interest grows over time
2. Use the formula: `interest = principal × rate × blocks / (100 × 52560)`
3. Repay sooner to minimize interest costs
4. See [Interest Calculator](INTEREST_CALCULATOR.md) for detailed examples

## Health Factor Warnings

### Health factor showing warning (110%–150%)

**Symptom:** Dashboard shows a yellow/amber warning on your health factor.

**Cause:** Your collateral-to-debt ratio is getting close to the liquidation threshold.

**Fix (choose one or both):**
1. **Add collateral:** Deposit more STX to increase your health factor
2. **Repay loan:** Pay back some or all of your loan to reduce debt

### Health factor below 110% — at risk of liquidation

**Symptom:** Dashboard shows a red danger indicator.

**Cause:** Your loan is undercollateralized and can be liquidated by anyone.

**Fix:**
1. **Repay immediately** — This is the safest option
2. If you can't repay, deposit more STX now to raise the health factor above 110%
3. Act quickly — once your health drops below 110%, any user can liquidate you

### Was I liquidated?

**Symptom:** Your deposit shows 0 and your loan disappeared.

**Cause:** Another user liquidated your undercollateralized loan.

**How to confirm:**
1. Check transaction history for a "Liquidation" event
2. Look on the [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.hiro.so) for your address
3. Look for a `liquidate` contract call involving your principal

**What happened:**
- The liquidator paid off your debt + a 5% bonus
- They received your collateral (deposit)
- Your loan was deleted and deposit was zeroed
- You keep the STX you originally borrowed

## Display Issues

### Dashboard shows "NaN" values

**Symptom:** Some stats show "NaN STX" instead of numbers.

**Cause:** This was a known bug in versions before 1.0.1 where Clarity value objects weren't converted properly.

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you're using the latest version of the app
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. Clear browser cache if the issue persists

### Wallet balance doesn't match explorer

**Symptom:** The balance shown in the app differs from the Stacks Explorer.

**Cause:** The app polls balances periodically (~10 seconds). There may be a brief delay.

**Fix:**
1. Wait 10 seconds for the next refresh
2. Refresh the page
3. If the difference persists, disconnect and reconnect your wallet

### Page is blank or won't load

**Symptom:** White screen, loading spinner that never stops, or JavaScript errors.

**Fix:**
1. Try a hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Clear browser cache and cookies for the site
3. Try a different browser
4. Disable browser extensions (especially ad blockers)
5. Check browser console (F12) for error messages

## Network Issues

### "Network request failed"

**Symptom:** Error toast showing network failure.

**Cause:** The Hiro API endpoint is unreachable.

**Fix:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try again in a few minutes — the API may be temporarily down
3. Check [Hiro Status](https://status.hiro.so) for outages
4. If persistent, try a VPN

### Wrong network (testnet vs mainnet)

**Symptom:** Address starts with `ST` instead of `SP`, or transactions go to the wrong contract.

**Cause:** Your wallet is set to testnet.

**Fix:**
1. Open your wallet (Leather or Xverse)
2. Go to Settings → Network
3. Switch to **Mainnet**
4. Refresh the BitFlow app
5. Your address should now start with `SP`
