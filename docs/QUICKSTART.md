BitFlow Finance is a decentralized lending protocol on the Stacks blockchain. You deposit STX as collateral, borrow against it, and repay with interest — all without intermediaries.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you need:

| Requirement | Where to Get It |
|---|---|
| Stacks wallet | [Leather Wallet](https://leather.io) or [Xverse](https://xverse.app) |
| STX tokens | Purchase on [OKX](https://okx.com), [Binance](https://binance.com), or [Gate.io](https://gate.io) |
| A modern browser | Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or Edge |

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet (1 min)

1. Open the BitFlow Finance app in your browser
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in the top-right corner
3. Select your wallet provider (Leather or Xverse)
4. Approve the connection in the wallet popup
5. Your STX balance appears next to your address

> **Tip:** Make sure your wallet is set to **Mainnet**. If you see `ST...` addresses, you're on testnet.

**What you'll see after connecting:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

1. Find the **"Deposit STX"** card on the dashboard
2. Enter the amount you want to deposit (e.g., `5`)

3. Select a **loan term** (7, 30, 90, or 365 days)
4. Set an **interest rate** (e.g., 500 = 5% APR)
5. Click **"Borrow STX"**
6. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
7. The borrowed STX appears in your wallet balance

### Quick Example

| Your Deposit | Max Borrow | Safe Borrow (recommended) |
|---|---|---|
| 5 STX | 3.33 STX | 2.50 STX |
| 10 STX | 6.66 STX | 5.00 STX |
| 50 STX | 33.33 STX | 25.00 STX |

> **Safety tip:** Borrow less than 50% of your deposit to keep your health factor well above the 110% liquidation threshold.

## What Happens Next?

After your first borrow, you have an active loan. Here's what to know:

### Monitor Your Health Factor

Your health factor shows how safe your loan is:

| Health Factor | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| > 150% | Safe | No action needed |
| 110–150% | Warning | Consider repaying or adding collateral |
| < 110% | Danger | **Repay immediately** or risk liquidation |

### Repay Your Loan

When you're ready to repay:

1. Go to the **"Repay Loan"** card
2. Click **"Repay Full Amount"**
3. The total includes your principal + accrued interest
4. Confirm in your wallet
5. Your collateral is unlocked for withdrawal

### Withdraw Your Deposit

After repaying your loan (or if you never borrowed):

1. Go to the **"Deposit STX"** card
2. Enter the withdrawal amount
3. Click **"Withdraw"**
4. STX returns to your wallet

## Common First-Timer Questions

**Q: What's the minimum deposit?**

**Q: Can I deposit more after my first deposit?**

**Q: How long does a transaction take?**
A: About 10 minutes (1 Stacks block). You'll see a pending status until it confirms.

**Q: What are the fees?**
A: Zero protocol fees in Phase 1. You only pay standard Stacks network transaction fees (~0.001 STX).
