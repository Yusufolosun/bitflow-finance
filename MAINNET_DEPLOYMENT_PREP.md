## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Step 1: Final Testing
```bash
# Run all tests one final time
npm test

# Run testnet SDK tests
npm run test:testnet

# Run contract check
clarinet check
```

### Step 2: Security Review
```bash
# Review contract one final time
cat contracts/bitflow-vault-core.clar

# Verify no sensitive data in contract
grep -i "private\|secret\|key\|password" contracts/bitflow-vault-core.clar
```

### Step 3: Fund Mainnet Wallet
- Ensure wallet has **at least 0.25 STX**
- Recommended: 1-2 STX for safety margin
- Verify wallet address is correct
- Test wallet can sign transactions

### Step 4: Generate Deployment Plan
```bash
# Generate mainnet deployment plan
clarinet deployments generate --mainnet --low-cost

# Review the plan
cat deployments/default.mainnet-plan.yaml
```

### Step 5: Deploy to Mainnet
```bash
# Use the safe deployment script (recommended)
./scripts/deploy-mainnet-safe.sh

# OR use manual deployment
./scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh
```

### Step 6: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Verify contract on Stacks Explorer
# https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/<YOUR_TX_ID>?chain=mainnet

# Test read-only functions
# Use the mainnet version of testnet-sdk-test.js

# Verify contract functions work
```

### Step 7: Update Frontend
```bash
# Update frontend config with mainnet contract address
# File: frontend/src/config/contracts.ts

# Update ACTIVE_NETWORK to 'mainnet'
# Update mainnet contract address
```

### Step 8: Monitor & Announce
- Monitor first transactions closely
- Set up alerts for unusual activity
- Announce deployment to community
- Update documentation with mainnet address
